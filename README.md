# RLM Explorer

An RL environment for training language models to actively explore **document collections** via code execution in a persistent REPL, rather than passively consuming retrieved context. Inspired by this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24601


## Why This Matters

There's a fundamental difference between a researcher who knows how to use a library card. There's searching, cross-referencing, computing, iterating, and someone who reads whatever you put on their desk. Standard RAG is the latter: retrieve top-k chunks, stuff them into a prompt, hope for the best. RLM Explorer is the former: the agent writes Python code to search, read, extract, and compute across documents, iterating until it's confident in its answer.

Research shows iterative exploration outperforms single-pass RAG by up to +25 percentage points on multi-hop questions, even when the single-pass system is given perfect oracle context.

## The Core Loop

```
env.reset()          →  Agent receives question + tool descriptions
env.step(code)       →  Agent writes Python, observes stdout/stderr
env.step(code)       →  Agent refines search, cross-references docs
env.step(code)       →  Agent computes aggregations, verifies findings
env.step(SUBMIT)     →  Agent submits answer + citations → receives reward
```

Each episode spawns a persistent Python session. Variables, DataFrames, and helper functions survive across steps — like a Jupyter notebook the agent controls. The reward signal is verifiable: token overlap F1 for answer accuracy, precision/recall for citations, and an efficiency bonus.

## Agent Tools

The REPL comes pre-loaded with tools the agent can call via Python code:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search(query, top_k=5)` | Document-level keyword search with TF-IDF scoring. Returns `[{"doc_id", "title", "chunk", "score"}]` |
| `search(query, method="chunk")` | Chunk-level search over 500-char overlapping windows — finds facts buried in long documents |
| `read(doc_id)` | Read full document text by ID |
| `extract(doc_id, pattern)` | Regex extraction from a document |
| `search_within(doc_id, query)` | Search inside a specific document — returns the most relevant 500-char windows ranked by score |
| `verify(doc_id, claim)` | Quick check if a claim's keywords appear in a document. Returns `{found, match_ratio, excerpt}` |
| `list_docs()` | List all documents in the corpus with titles and character counts |

The agent learns to compose these tools across steps. For example, a multi-hop question might require:

```
Step 1: search("Project Phoenix")           → finds board minutes
Step 2: search_within(board_doc, "partner")  → finds "refer to codename registry"
Step 3: search("codename registry")          → finds registry document
Step 4: read(registry_doc)                   → discovers Phoenix = Meridian Ltd
Step 5: search("Meridian compliance")        → finds compliance report
Step 6: SUBMIT answer with citations from all 3 documents
```

Variables persist across steps, so the agent can track discoveries in a `known_facts = {}` dictionary and use them in subsequent searches.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/jasonlingg/rlm-explorer.git
cd rlm-explorer
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Generate synthetic corpus (43 cross-referencing business documents)
python scripts/setup_corpus.py

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run Claude policy on one question
python scripts/run_eval.py --policy claude_policy --question q01 --verbose

# Run full evaluation (all policies, all 18 easy questions)
python scripts/run_eval.py

# Run hard multi-hop evaluation (12 questions, 2-5 hops)
python scripts/run_eval.py --hard --max-steps 15
```

## Reward Signal

The reward is designed for GRPO training:

```
reward = 0.5 × answer_F1 + 0.25 × citation_precision + 0.25 × citation_recall + efficiency_bonus
```

- **Answer F1**: Token overlap between predicted and gold answer
- **Citation Precision**: Fraction of cited documents that are correct
- **Citation Recall**: Fraction of required documents that were cited
- **Efficiency Bonus**: Up to 0.2 extra for solving in fewer steps

## Question Types

### Easy Set (18 questions)
- **Cross-document aggregation**: Combine numbers from multiple documents
- **Cross-document comparison**: Compare metrics or clauses across documents
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: Find X in doc A → look up related info in doc B
- **Single-document extraction**: Straightforward lookups (baseline sanity check)
- **Contradiction detection**: Identify inconsistencies across documents

### Hard Set (12 questions, 2-5 hops)
Designed with [MuSiQue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00573) anti-shortcut methodology — no single chunk or document can answer any question, and competing distractor entities exist for every answer type.

- **Hidden bridge**: Answer depends on an intermediate entity NOT named in the question (e.g., codename → real company)
- **Disambiguation**: Multiple competing candidates match the description; agent must use relational attributes to pick the right one
- **Fan-out aggregation**: Identify N entities from an index document, look up each one, then compute across all
- **Parallel comparison**: Two independent discovery chains, then compare results
- **Codename bridging**: Project codenames map to real entities via a separate registry document

## Future Work

Plug in an open-weight model (Llama, Qwen) with GRPO on Prime Intellect to train a model that learns exploration behavior from this environment's reward signal.
